# Casmil-Ahao-Stephen
I am currently a student at Mahanaim University, and my primary focus is on computer programming. Mahanaim University provides a well rounded technology education, with courses that include the computer programming that I am learning, and also diploma courses in Information Communication Technology. I am working on developing my skills in the computer science field within the environment that Mahanaim University provides.

#  My current learning goals/interests
My current learning goals center on building a robust foundation in core programming concepts and practical software development skills, while also expanding my technological proficiency to encompass broader areas like networking and databases. Aligned with Mahanaim University's holistic approach, I aim to integrate ethical considerations and strong values into my work, focusing on problem-solving, teamwork, and ultimately, applying my skills to create impactful solutions that address real-world challenges.

#  Technologies/Languages that am Studying 
In the realm of web development, my current studies focus on mastering the fundamental languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which form the core of front-end development. I'm also exploring back-end technologies, potentially including Node.js for server-side JavaScript, and SQL for database management.

#  Current project
My current project involves building a dynamic, interactive web application. I'm focusing on utilizing JavaScript frameworks, like React, to create a user-friendly front-end, while also developing the back-end using Node.js and a SQL database. The project aims to integrate the principles of ethical technology that are emphasized at Mahanaim University, ensuring accessibility and responsible data handling. I am focused on applying the web development skills I have learned to build a functional and useful product. This also involves the use of Git, and other version control software, to provide a well documented and structured project.
